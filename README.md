# Hello High Energy community-  

I am Akinchan Kundu. I obtained an M.Sc. in Astrophysics from Presidency University, Kolkata. My work focused on High Energy Particle Physics and Observational Astrophysics. In HEP, I work on Neutrino Physics: Neutrino Oscillation, BSM physics with Neutrino, Lorentz Invariance Violation with neutrinos, etc. In Observational Astrophysics, I worked in Stellar astrophysics, focusing on B-type emission star studies.
